         <div class="home">Proceeding, fellow-citizens, to that qualification which the Constitution requires
            before
            my entrance on the charge again conferred on me, it is my duty to express the deep sense I entertain of this new proof of confidence from
            my fellow-citizens at large, and the zeal with which it inspires me so to conduct
            myself
            as may best satisfy their just expectations.<br/>On taking this station on a former occasion I declared the principles on which I believed
            it my duty to administer the affairs of our Commonwealth. My
            conscience tells me I have on every occasion acted up to that declaration according
            to its obvious import and to the understanding of every candid mind.<br/>In the transaction of your foreign affairs we have endeavored to cultivate the <span class="policy foreign">friendship of all nations, and especially of those with which we
               have the most important relations</span>. We have done them justice on all
            occasions, favored where favor was lawful, and cherished mutual interests and
            intercourse on fair and equal terms. We are firmly convinced,
            and we act on that conviction, that with nations as with individuals our interests
            soundly calculated will ever be found inseparable from our moral duties, and history
            bears witness to the fact that a just nation is trusted on its word when recourse
            is
            had to armaments and wars to bridle others.<br/>At home, fellow-citizens, you best know whether we have done well or ill. <span class="policy economy">The suppression of unnecessary offices, of useless
               establishments and expenses, enabled us to discontinue our internal taxes</span>.
            These, <span class="policy government">covering our land with officers and opening
               our doors to their intrusions, had already begun that process of domiciliary
               vexation which once entered is scarcely to be restrained from reaching successively
               every article of property and produce</span>. If among these taxes some minor ones
            fell which had not been inconvenient, it was because their amount would not have paid
            the officers who collected them, and because, if they had any merit, the State
            authorities might adopt them instead of others less approved.<br/>The remaining revenue on the consumption of foreign
            articles is paid chiefly by those who can afford to add foreign luxuries to
            domestic comforts, being collected on our seaboard and frontiers only, and incorporated
            with the transactions of our mercantile citizens, it may be the pleasure and the <span class="value patriotism">pride of an American</span> to ask, What farmer, what
            mechanic, what laborer ever sees a tax gatherer of the United States? These
            contributions enable us to support the current expenses of the Government, <span class="policy foreign">to fulfill
               contracts with foreign nations</span>,to extinguish the native right of soil within our limits,
            to extend those limits, and to <span class="policy economy">apply such a surplus to our public debts as places at a
               short day their final redemption</span>, and that redemption once effected the revenue there by
            liberated may, by a just repartition of it among the States and a corresponding
            amendment of the Constitution, be applied in time of <span class="policy economy">peace torivers, canals, roads, arts, manufactures, education, and other great
               objects</span> within each State. In time of war, if injustice by ourselves or
            others must sometimes produce war, increased as the same revenue will be by increased
            population and consumption, and aided by other resources reserved for that crisis,
            <span class="policy economy">it
               may meet within the year all the expenses of the year without encroaching on the rights
               of future generations by burthening them with the debts of the past</span>. War will then be
            but a suspension of useful works, and are turn to a state of peace, a return to the
            progress of improvement.<br/>I have said, <span class="value unity">fellow-citizens</span>, that the income reserved had
            enabled us to extend our limits, but that extension may possibly pay for itself before
            we are called on,and in the mean time may keep down the accruing interest; in all
            events, it will replace the advances we shall have made. <span class="policy government">I know that the acquisition of
               Louisiana had been disapproved by some from a candid apprehension that the enlargement
               of our territory would endanger its union. But who can limit the extent to which the
               federative principle may operate effectively? The larger our association the less
               will
               it be shaken by local passions;</span> and in any view is it not better that the opposite bank
            of the Mississippi should be settled by our own brethren and children than by strangers
            of another family? With which should we be most likely to live in harmony and friendly
            intercourse?<br/><span class="policy civil_rights">In matters of religion I have considered that its
               free exercise is placed by the Constitution independent of the powers of the General
               Government</span>. I have therefore undertaken on no occasion to prescribe the
            religious exercises suited to it, but have left them, as the Constitution found them,
            under the direction and discipline of the church or state authorities acknowledged
            by
            the several religious societies.<br/>The aboriginal inhabitants of these countries I have regarded with the commiseration
            their history inspires. Endowed with the faculties and the rights of men, breathing
            an
            ardent love of liberty and independence, and occupying acountry which left them no
            desire but to be undisturbed, the stream of overflowing population from other regions
            directed itself on these shores; without power to divert or habits to contend against
            it, they have been overwhelmed by the current or driven before it; now reduced within
            limits too narrow for the hunterâ€™s state, <span class="policy government">humanity
               enjoins us to teach them agriculture and the domestic arts; to encourage them to
               that industry which alone canenable them to maintain their place in existence and
               to
               prepare them in time for that state of society which to bodily comforts adds the
               improvement of themind and morals</span>. We have therefore liberally furnished
            them with the implements of husbandry and household use; we have placed among them
            instructors in thearts of first necessity, and they are covered with the aegis of
            the
            law against aggressors from among ourselves.<br/>But the endeavors to enlighten them on the fate which awaits their present course
            of life,
            to induce them to exercise their reason, follow its dictates, and change their pursuits
            with the change of circumstances have powerful obstacles to encounter; they are combated
            by the habits of their bodies, prejudices of their minds, ignorance, pride, and the
            influence of interested and crafty individuals among them who feel themselves something
            in the present order of things and fear to become nothing in any other. <span class="policy government">These persons
               inculcate a sanctimonious reverence for the customs of their ancestors; that whatsoever
               they did must be done through all time; that reason is a false guide, and to advance
               under its counsel in their physical, moral, or political condition is perilous
               innovation; that their duty is to remain as their Creator made them,ignorance being
               safety and knowledge full of danger; in short, my friends,among them also is seen
               the
               action and counteraction of good sense and of bigotry; they too have their
               antiphilosophists who find an interest in keeping things in their present state, who
               dread reformation, and exert all their faculties to maintain the ascendancy of habit
               over the duty of improving our reason and obeying its mandates.</span><br/>In giving these outlines I do not mean, <span class="value unity">fellow-citizens</span>, to
            arrogate to myself the merit of the measures. That is due, in the first place, to
            the
            reflecting character of our citizens at large, who, by the weight of public opinion,
            influence and strengthen the public measures. It is due to the sound discretion with
            which they select from among themselves those to whom they confide the legislative
            duties. It is due to the zeal and wisdom of the characters thus selected, who lay
            the
            foundations of public happiness in wholesome laws, theexecution of which alone remains
            for others, and it is due to the able and faithful auxiliaries, whose patriotism has
            associated them with me in the executive functions.<br/>During this course of administration, and in order to disturb it, the artillery of
            the
            press has been leveled against us, charged with whatsoever its licentiousness could
            devise or dare. These abuses of an institution so important to freedom and science
            are
            deeply to be regretted, in as much as they tend to lessen its usefulness and to sap
            its
            safety. They might, indeed, have been corrected by the wholesome punishments reserved
            to
            and provided by the laws of the several States against falsehood and defamation, but
            public duties more urgent press on the time of public servants, and the offenders have therefore been left to find their punishment
            in the public indignation.<br/>Nor was it uninteresting to the world that an experiment should be fairly and fully
            made,
            whether freedom of discussion, unaided by power, is not sufficient for the propagation
            and protection of truthâ€”whether a government
            conducting itself in the true spirit of its constitution, with zeal and purity, and
            doing no act which it would be unwilling the whole world should witness, can be written
            down by falsehood and defamation. The experiment has been tried; you have witnessed
            the
            scene; our <span class="value unity">fellow-citizens</span> looked on, cool and collected;
            they saw the latent source from which these outrages proceeded; they gathered around
            their public functionaries, and when the Constitution called them to the decision
            by
            suffrage, they pronounced their verdict, honorable to those who had served them and
            consolatory to the friend of man who believes that he may be trusted with the control
            of
            his own affairs.<br/>No inference is here intended that the laws provided by the States against false and
            defamatory publications should not be enforced; he who has time renders a service
            to
            public morals and public tranquillity in reforming these abuses by the salutary
            coercions of the law; but the experiment is noted to prove that,since truth and reason
            have maintained their ground against false opinions in league with false facts, the
            press, confined to truth, needs no other legal restraint; <span class="value unity">the
               public judgment will correct false reasoning and opinions on afull hearing of all
               parties</span>; and no other definite line can be drawn between the inestimable
            liberty of the press and its demoralizing licentiousness. If there be still
            improprieties which this rule would not restrain, its supplement must be sought in
            the
            censorship of public opinion.<br/>Contemplating the union of sentiment now manifested so generally as auguring harmony
            and
            happiness to our future course, I offer to our country sincere congratulations. With
            those, too, not yet rallied to the same point the disposition to do so is gaining
            strength; facts are piercing through the veil drawn over them, and our doubting brethren
            will at length see that the mass of their fellow-citizens with whom they can not yet
            resolve to act as to principles and measures, think as they think and desire what
            they
            desire; that our wish as well as theirs is that the public efforts may be directed
            honestly to the public good, that peace be cultivated, civil and religious liberty
            unassailed, law and order preserved, equality of rights maintained, and that state
            of
            property, equal or unequal, which results to every man from his own industry or that
            of
            his fatherâ€™s. When satisfied of these views it is not inhuman nature that they should
            not approve and support them. In the meantime let us cherish them with patient
            affection, let us do them justice, and more than justice, in all competitions of
            interest; and we need not doubt that truth,reason, and their own interests will at
            length prevail, will gather them into the fold of their country, and will complete
            that
            entire union of opinion which gives to a nation the blessing of harmony and the benefit
            of all its strength.<br/> I shall now enter on the duties to which my <span class="value unity">fellow-citizens</span>
            have again called me,and shall proceed in the spirit of those principles which they
            have
            approved. I fear not that any motives of interest may lead me astray; I am sensible
            of
            no passion which could seduce me knowingly from the path of justice, but the weaknesses
            of human nature and the <span class="value humility">limits of my own
               understanding</span> will produceerrors of judgment sometimes injurious to your
            interests. I shall need,therefore, all the indulgence which I have heretofore
            experienced from myconstituents; the want of it will certainly not lessen with
            increasingyears. I shall need,too, the favor of that <span class="value religion">Being</span> in whose hands weare, who led our fathers, as Israel of old, from
            their native land andplanted them in a country flowing with all the necessaries and
            comfortsof life; who has covered our infancy with <span class="value religion">His</span>
            providence and our riper years with <span class="value religion">His</span> wisdom and
            power, and to whose goodness I ask you to join in supplications with me that <span class="value religion">He</span> will soenlighten the minds of your servants, guide
            their councils, and prospertheir measures that whatsoever they do shall result in
            your
            good, andshall secure to you the peace, friendship, and approbation of allnations.
