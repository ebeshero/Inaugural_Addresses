         <div class="home">Mr. Vice President, Mr. Chief Justice, and fellow citizens, I accept with humility
            the honor which the American people have conferred upon me. I accept it with a
            deep resolve to do all that I can for the welfare of this Nation and for the
            peace of the world.<br/>In performing the duties of my office, I need the help and prayers of every one of
            you. I ask for your encouragement and your support. The tasks we face are difficult, and we can accomplish them only if we
            work together.<br/>Each period of our national history has had its special
            challenges. Those that confront us now are as momentous as any in the
            past. Today marks the beginning not only of a new administration,
            but of a period that will be eventful, perhaps decisive, for us and for the
            world.<br/>It may be our lot to experience, and in large measure to bring about, a major
            turning point in the long history of the human race. The
            first half of this century has been marked by unprecedented and brutal
            attacks on the rights of man, and by the two most frightful wars in
            history. <span class="policy military">The supreme need of our time is
               for men to learn to live together in peace and harmony</span>.<br/>The peoples of the earth face the future with grave
            uncertainty, composed almost equally of great hopes and great
            fears. In this time of doubt, they look to the United States as
            never before for good will, strength, and wise leadership.<br/>It is fitting, therefore, that we take this occasion to proclaim to the world the
            essential principles of the faith by which we live, and to declare our aims to
            all peoples.<br/>The American people stand firm in the faith which has inspired this Nation from the
            beginning. <span class="value equality">We believe that all men have a right to equal
               justice under law and equal opportunity to share in the common good. We
               believe that all men have the right to freedom of thought and
               expression</span>. <span class="value religion">We believe that all men are
               created equal because they are created in the image of God.</span><br/>From this faith we will not be moved.<br/><span class="value liberty">The American people desire, and are determined to work for, a
               world in which all nations and all peoples are free to govern themselves
               as they see fit, and to achieve a decent and satisfying life</span>.
            <span class="policy military">Above all else, our people desire, and are
               determined to work for, peace on earth—a just and lasting peace—based on
               genuine agreement freely arrived at by equals</span>.<br/>In the pursuit of these aims, the United States and other like-minded nations find
            themselves directly opposed by a regime with contrary aims and a totally
            different concept of life.<br/>That regime adheres to a false philosophy which purports
            to offer freedom, security, and greater opportunity to mankind. Misled
            by this philosophy, many peoples have sacrificed their liberties only to
            learn to their sorrow that deceit and mockery, poverty and tyranny, are
            their reward.<br/>That false philosophy is communism.<br/><span class="value democracy">Communism is based on the belief that man is so weak and
               inadequate that he is unable to govern himself, and therefore requires
               the rule of strong masters</span>.<br/><span class="value democracy">&gt;Democracy is based on the conviction that man has the
               moral and intellectual capacity, as well as the inalienable right, to
               govern himself with reason and justice</span>.<br/>Communism subjects the individual to arrest without lawful cause, punishment
            without trial, and forced labor as the chattel of the state. It decrees what
            information he shall receive, what art he shall produce, what leaders he shall
            follow, and what thoughts he shall think.<br/><span class="value democracy">Democracy maintains that government is established for the
               benefit of the individual, and is charged with the responsibility of
               protecting the rights of the individual and his freedom in the exercise
               of his abilities</span>.<br/>Communism maintains that social wrongs can be corrected only by violence.<br/><span class="value democracy">Democracy has proved that social justice can be achieved
               through peaceful change</span>.<br/>Communism holds that the world is so deeply divided into opposing classes that war
            is inevitable.<br/><span class="value democracy">Democracy holds that free nations can settle differences
               justly and maintain lasting peace</span>.<br/>These differences between communism and democracy do not concern the United States
            alone.People everywhere are coming to realize that what is involved is material
            well-being, human dignity, and <span class="value religion">the right to believe in
               and worship God</span>.<br/>I state these differences, not to draw issues of belief as such, but because the
            actions resulting from the Communist philosophy are a threat to the efforts of
            free nations to bring about world recovery and lasting peace.<br/><span class="policy military">Since the end of hostilities, the United States has
               invested its substance and its energy in a great constructive effort to
               restore peace, stability, and freedom to the world</span>.<br/>We have sought no territory and we have imposed our will on none. We have asked for
            no privileges we would not extend to others.<br/><span class="policy foreign">We have constantly and vigorously supported the
               United Nations and related agencies as a means of applying democratic
               principles to international relations. We have consistently advocated
               and relied upon peaceful settlement of disputes among
               nations</span>.<br/><span class="policy military">We have made every effort to secure agreement on effective
               international control of our most powerful weapon, and we have worked
               steadily for the limitation and control of all armaments</span>.<br/><span class="policy foreign">We have encouraged, by precept and example, the
               expansion of world trade on a sound and fair basis</span>.<br/>Almost a year ago, in company with 16 free nations of Europe, we launched the
            greatest cooperative economic program in history. <span class="value liberty">The
               purpose of that unprecedented effort is to invigorate and strengthen
               democracy in Europe, so that the free people of that continent can
               resume their rightful place in the forefront of civilization and can
               contribute once more to the security and welfare of the
               world</span>.<br/>Our efforts have brought new hope to all mankind. We have
            beaten back despair and defeatism. We have saved a number of countries
            from losing their liberty. Hundreds of millions of people all
            over the world now agree with us, that we need not have war—that we can have
            peace.<br/>The initiative is ours.<br/><span class="policy foreign">We are moving on with other nations to build an
               even stronger structure of international order and justice. We shall
               have as our partners countries which, no longer solely concerned with
               the problem of national survival, are now working to improve the
               standards of living of all their people</span>. We are ready to
            undertake new projects to strengthen the free world.<br/>In the coming years, our program for peace and freedom will emphasize four major
            courses of action.<br/><span class="policy foreign">First, we will continue to give unfaltering
               support to the United Nations and related agencies, and we will continue
               to search for ways to strengthen their authority and increase their
               effectiveness. We believe that the United Nations will be strengthened
               by the new nations which are being formed in lands now advancing toward
               self-government under democratic principles</span>.<br/><span class="policy economy">Second, we will continue our programs for world
               economic recovery</span>.<br/>This means, first of all, that we must keep our full weight behind the European
            recovery program. We are confident of the success of this major venture in
            world recovery. We believe that our partners in this effort will achieve the
            status of self-supporting nations once again.<br/><span class="policy foreign">In addition, we must carry out our plans for
               reducing the barriers to world trade and increasing its volume. Economic
               recovery and peace itself depend on increased world trade</span>.<br/>Third, we will strengthen freedom-loving nations against the dangers of
            aggression.<br/><span class="policy foreign">We are now working out with a number of
               countries a joint agreement designed to strengthen the security of the
               North Atlantic area. Such an agreement would take the form of a
               collective defense arrangement within the terms of the United Nations
               Charter</span>.<br/><span class="policy foreign">We have already established such a defense pact
               for the Western Hemisphere by the treaty of Rio de Janeiro</span>.<br/><span class="policy foreign">The primary purpose of these agreements is to
               provide unmistakable proof of the joint determination of the free
               countries to resist armed attack from any quarter. Each country
               participating in these arrangements must contribute all it can to the
               common defense</span>.<br/><span class="value security">If we can make it sufficiently clear, in advance, that any
               armed attack affecting our national security would be met with
               overwhelming force, the armed attack might never occur</span>.<br/><span class="policy foreign">I hope soon to send to the Senate a treaty
               respecting the North Atlantic security plan</span>.<br/><span class="policy military">In addition, we will provide military advice and
               equipment to free nations which will cooperate with us in the
               maintenance of peace and security</span>.<br/><span class="value science">Fourth, we must embark on a bold new program for making the
               benefits of our scientific advances</span> and industrial progress
            available for the improvement and growth of underdeveloped areas.<br/>More than half the people of the world are living in
            conditions approaching misery. Their food is inadequate. They are
            victims of disease. Their economic life is primitive and stagnant. Their
            poverty is a handicap and a threat both to them and to more prosperous
            areas.<br/><span class="value science">For the first time in history, humanity possesses the
               knowledge and the skill to relieve the suffering of these
               people</span>.<br/><span class="value science">The United States is pre-eminent among nations in the
               development of industrial and scientific techniques. The material
               resources which we can afford to use for the assistance of other peoples
               are limited. But our imponderable resources in technical knowledge are
               constantly growing and are inexhaustible</span>.<br/>I believe that we should make available to peace-loving peoples the benefits of our
            store of technical knowledge in order to help them realize their aspirations
            for a better life. And, in cooperation with other nations, we should foster
            capital investment in areas needing development.<br/>Our aim should be to help the free peoples of the world, through their own efforts,
            to produce more food, more clothing, more materials for housing, and more
            mechanical power to lighten their burdens.<br/><span class="policy foreign">We invite other countries to pool their
               technological resources in this undertaking. Their contributions will be
               warmly welcomed. This should be a cooperative enterprise in which all
               nations work together through the United Nations and its specialized
               agencies wherever practicable. It must be a worldwide effort for the
               achievement of peace, plenty, and freedom</span>.<br/>With the cooperation of business, private capital, agriculture, and labor in this
            country, this program can greatly increase the industrial activity in other
            nations and can raise substantially their standards of living.<br/><span class="policy economy">Such new economic developments must be devised and
               controlled to benefit the peoples of the areas in which they are
               established</span>. Guarantees to the investor must be balanced by
            guarantees in the interest of the people whose resources and whose labor go
            into these developments.<br/><span class="value democracy">The old imperialism—exploitation for foreign profit—has no
               place in our plans. What we envisage is a program of development based
               on the concepts of democratic fair-dealing</span>.<br/><span class="policy foreign">All countries, including our own, will greatly
               benefit from a constructive program for the better use of the world's
               human and natural resources. Experience shows that our commerce with
               other countries expands as they progress industrially and
               economically</span>.<br/><span class="value science">Greater production is the key to prosperity and peace. And
               the key to greater production is a wider and more vigorous application
               of modern scientific and technical knowledge</span>.<br/>Only by helping the least fortunate of its members to help themselves can the human
            family achieve the decent, satisfying life that is the right of all people.
            56<br/><span class="value democracy">Democracy alone can supply the vitalizing force to stir the
               peoples of the world into triumphant action</span>, not only against
            their human oppressors, but also against their ancient enemies—hunger, misery,
            and despair.<br/>On the basis of these four major courses of action we hope to help create the
            conditions that will lead eventually to personal freedom and happiness for all
            mankind.<br/>If we are to be successful in carrying out these policies, it is clear that we must
            have continued prosperity in this country and we must keep ourselves
            strong.<br/><span class="policy foreign">Slowly but surely we are weaving a world fabric
               of international security and growing prosperity</span>.<br/>We are aided by all who wish to live in freedom from fear—even by those who live
            today in fear under their own governments.<br/>We are aided by all who want relief from the lies of propaganda—who desire truth
            and sincerity.<br/><span class="value liberty">We are aided by all who desire self-government and a voice in
               deciding their own affairs</span>.<br/>We are aided by all who long for economic security—for the security and abundance
            that men in free societies can enjoy.<br/><span class="value liberty">We are aided by all who desire freedom of speech, freedom of
               religion, and freedom to live their own lives for useful
               ends</span>.<br/>Our allies are the millions who hunger and thirst after righteousness.<br/>In due time, as our stability becomes manifest, as more and more nations come to
            know the benefits of democracy and to participate in growing abundance, I believe that those countries which now oppose us
            will abandon their delusions and join with the free nations of the world
            in a just settlement of international differences.<br/>Events have brought our American democracy to new influence and new
            responsibilities. They will test our courage, our devotion to duty, and our
            concept of liberty.<br/><span class="value liberty">But I say to all men, what we have achieved in liberty, we
               will surpass in greater liberty</span>.<br/><span class="value religion">Steadfast in our faith in the Almighty, we will advance
               toward a world where man's freedom is secure</span>.<br/>To that end we will devote our strength, our resources, and our firmness of
            resolve. <span class="value religion">With God's help, the future of mankind will be
               assured in a world of justice, harmony, and peace</span>.<br/></div>
