                <p>This project concentrates on the evolution of principles reflected in
                    Presidential Inaugural Addresses. As it serves as an introductory speech for a
                    newly elected President, Inaugural Addresses set the tone or goals for an
                    upcoming term. Delivering these addresses provides an opportunity for
                    communication of American leadership with citizens. They can uplift listeners,
                    guiding the country through a particular hardship or reflect a change in
                    governmental ideals. Whether exhaustive or short, the speech sets the basis of
                    the executive branchâ€™s aims or models for the upcoming four years.</p>
                <p>Our research focuses on the attached values and policies found in Presidential
                    Inaugural Addresses. We specifically targeted the ways these changes may differ
                    by political party and religious affiliation. Our analysis began through
                    adapting the XML of a <a href="http://inaugural.obdurodon.org/index.xhtml"
                        >previous Digital Humanities project</a>. On our addresses page you can find
                    a reading view of our markup, originally intended to highlight the different
                    tone, values, and policies found within each address. Please see our results
                    page to see how we analyzed the addresses following our initial markup through
                    MALLET and Network Analysis. </p>
