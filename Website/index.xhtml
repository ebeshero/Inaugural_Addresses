            <p>The purpose of this research project is to study how the importance of religion and
                the relevance of different policies change over time throughout United States
                presidential inaugural addresses. From this data, several things can be extracted.
                First of all, we will analyze which presidents are more religious and why. Was it
                due to a time of national strife, or was it based on their party affiliation?
                Additionally, we will seek to discover which policies were important to which
                presidents. While these are bound to change over time, could it also have something
                to do with party affiliation? These are the questions we hope to answer through our
                analysis of the Presidential Inaugural Addresses.</p>
