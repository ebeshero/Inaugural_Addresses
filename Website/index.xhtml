        <div id="home"><p>The purpose of this research project is to study how the importance of religion and the
        relevance of different policies change over time throughout United States presidential
        inaugural addresses. From this data, several things can be extracted. First of all, we will
        analyze which presidents are more religious and why. Was it due to a time of national
        strife, or was it based on their party affiliation? Additionally, we will seek to discover
        which policies were important to which presidents. While these are bound to change over
        time, could it also have something to do with party affiliation? These are the questions we
        hope to answer through our analysis of the Presidential Inaugural Addresses.</p></div>
