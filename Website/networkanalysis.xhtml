            <p>The network above displays all of the different policies and values tagged within
                each speech and how they are connected to each other. Policies such as "civil
                rights", "education", and "health" are denoted with a black circle while values
                like "liberty" and "religion" are represented as white diamonds. The various
                lines each represent a different president. Therefore, the goal of this network
                is to analyze which values and policies appear together in specific speeches.
                The nodes are organized in a circle by increasing amount of degree, that is how
                many edges are touching the node.</p>
            <p>At the bottom of the network, one can observe the node with the largest degree is
                the policy of "economy," meaning it has more connections than any other node.
                This is unsurprising due to the fact that it is hard to carry out policies
                regarding welfare, health, or education without taking economics into
                consideration. Additionally, it was interesting to observe that the policy with
                the second-highest node value was "foreign". "Foreign" was used in the markup to
                tag issues of foreign affairs and international cooperation or disagreement.
                While it is difficult to observe in this specific network, the Mallet section of
                our analysis shows how foreign affairs remains an important topic for presidents
                over the years.</p>
            <p>In terms of the value nodes, the one with the largest degree is religion. As
                researchers, we were not surprised to learn this as we encountered many
                religious references in the speeches throughout our initial markup.
                Approximately every president, regardless of party affiliation or time period,
                made a reference to God at least once. Although the United States government
                technically operates with the separation of church and state built into its
                values, the sheer amount of religious references that appear in presidents'
                inaugural addresses causes one to reexamine how large that separation may
                actually be.</p>
            <p>Due to the sheer size of this network, we created subnetworks in order to observe
                direct connections more closely. By examining networks of presidents <a
                    href="#jefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a>, <a href="#lincoln">Abraham
                        Lincoln</a>, <a href="#fdr">Franklin Delano Roosevelt</a>, <a href="#trump"
                            >Donald Trump</a>, and <a href="biden">Joe Biden</a>, we will better be able
                to determine which values and policies remain important over time.</p>

            <h3><a id="#jefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a></h3>
            <embed src="jefferson.svg"/>
            <p>President Thomas Jefferson's subnetwork is relatively easy to read simply because
                he focuses on three main policies: economy, civil rights, and patriotism. In
                this case, we can literally count the edges and observe that the policy he
                mentioned the most was that of civil rights. It is a bit surpising that civil
                rights has a larger degree than economy in this subnetwork. However we can see
                that civil rights is connected to every value Jefferson mentions: religion,
                unity, democracy, and equality. Because he was only the third president, perhaps
                he spent much of his inaugural address discussing the Bill of Rights and the
                liberties that automatically come with being a citizen of the United States.

            <h3><a id="lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a></h3>
            <embed src="lincoln.svg"/>
            <p>President Abraham Lincoln's subwork contains much less overlap between the nodes
                than that of Jefferson. Additionally, every node has exactly three or four
                edges. This may tell us thata Lincoln's inaugural addresses were very structured
                and organized. In regards to policy, there is no appearance of economy even
                though it was the node with the largest degree in the general network. Like
                Jefferson, his most prevalent policy is civil rights which is unsurprising due
                to the fact that he is the president who ended slavey. We see that the policy of
                civil rights occurs with all the values Lincoln mentions: democracy, religion,
                and liberty. However, it is never associated with the other policy of
                government, which is an interesting observation.</p>

        <div>
            <h3><a id="fdr">Franklin Delano Roosevelt</a></h3>
            <embed src="roosevelt.svg"/>
            <p>FDR's network, like the other two presidents, is relatively easy to understand.
                Like Lincoln, his subnetwork does not contain a lot of overlap. In the center of
                all of it is the policy of economy. There re a few different reasons this may be
                the case. First of all, most of FDR's policy regarded getting the American
                economy back on its feet. He focused on the Three R's: relief of the unemployed
                and poor, recovery of the economy back to normal levels, and reform of the
                financial system to prevent a repeat depression. Additionally, FDR was the only
                president to serve more than two terms, instead serving 3.5. This subnetwork
                contains 4 speeches from this president while others only have 1 or 2. This may
                provide explanation for the node degree of economy in his network. </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3><a id="trump">Donald Trump</a></h3>
            <embed src="trump.svg"/>
            <p>President Trump's subnetwork is far more complex than the above three, and this
                may just be due to the fact that his term was more recent. As time progresses,
                we see topics emerge that did not need consideration 50 years ago. For instance,
                science appears in this network and has not in any of the other subnetworks.
                Subjects like climate change and terrorism are problems that were not around or
                considered by earlier presidents. Additionally, one interesting connection we
                can see with Trump's data is that although he may mention foreign policy a great
                deal, it is often associated with patriotism. This may tell a researcher that
                Trump prefers an 'America First' policy when it comes to international
                affairs.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3><a id="biden">Joe Biden</a></h3>
            <embed src="biden.svg"/>
            <p>President Joe Biden's subetwork seems to have more criss-cross than Trump's. We
                choose to compare these as Trump's term was right before Biden's. It is a bit
                like comparing Jefferson and Lincoln's networks. Jefferson's was more all over
                the place while Lincoln's speech seemed more structured. Perhaps that is what we
                are seeing with Biden's speech as many of his discussion points connected to
                various others. Like some earlier presidents, the topic of civil rights is
                connected to every value mentioned. It is also hard to determine just by
                observation which node has the largest degree. While economy does have a lot of
                edges, so does civil rights and health. Civil rights may be so large due to the
                recent Black Lives Matter movement regarding specifically police brutality.
                Health, while not seen in any of the other subnetworks analyzed, is so large
                because Biden was tasked with managing the COVID-19 pandemic as soon as he came
                into office. People wanted to hear his plans and course of action to get
                theUnited States back in its feet, and he addressed much of that in his
                inaugural speech. </p>
