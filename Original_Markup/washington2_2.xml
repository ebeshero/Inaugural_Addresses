        <p>Fellow Citizens:</p>

        <p>I am again called upon by the voice of my country to execute the functions of its Chief
            Magistrate. When the occasion proper for it shall arrive, I shall endeavor to express
            the high sense I entertain of this distinguished honor, and of the confidence which has
            been reposed in me by the people of united America.</p>

        <p>Previous to the execution of any official act of the President the Constitution requires
            an oath of office. This oath I am now about to take, and in your presence: That if it
            shall be found during my administration of the Government I have in any instance
            violated willingly or knowingly the injunctions thereof, I may (besides incurring
            constitutional punishment) be subject to the upbraidings of all who are now witnesses of
            the present solemn ceremony.</p>
    </body>

</speech>
