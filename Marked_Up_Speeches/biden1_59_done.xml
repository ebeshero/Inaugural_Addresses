        <p>Chief Justice Roberts, Vice President Harris, Speaker Pelosi, Leader Schumer, Leader
            McConnell, Vice President Pence, distinguished guests, and my fellow Americans.</p>
        <p>This is America’s day. This is democracy’s day. A day of history and hope. Of renewal and
            resolve. <tone emotion="hope">Through a crucible for the ages America has been tested
                anew and America has risen to the challenge</tone>.</p>
        <p> Today, we celebrate the triumph not of a candidate, but of a cause, the cause of
            democracy. The will of the people has been heard and the will of the people has been
            heeded. We have learned again that democracy is precious. Democracy is fragile. <tone
                emotion="triumph">And at this hour, my friends, democracy has prevailed</tone>.</p>
        <p>So now, on this hallowed ground where just days ago violence sought to shake this
            Capitol’s very foundation, <value national="unity">we come together as one
                nation</value>, under God, indivisible, to carry out the peaceful transfer of power
            as we have for more than two centuries. <tone emotion="hope">We look ahead in our
                uniquely American way – restless, bold, optimistic – and set our sights on the
                nation we know we can be and we must be</tone>.</p>
        <p>I thank my predecessors of both parties for their presence here. I thank them from the
            bottom of my heart. You know the resilience of our Constitution and the strength of our
            nation. As does President Carter, who I spoke to last night but who cannot be with us
            today, but whom we salute for his lifetime of service. I have just taken the sacred oath
            each of these patriots took — an oath first sworn by George Washington.</p>
        <p><value national="unity">But the American story depends not on any one of us, not on some
                of us, but on all of us. On “We the People” who seek a more perfect Union. This is a
                great nation and we are a good people</value>. Over the centuries through storm and
            strife, in peace and in war, we have come so far. But we still have far to go. We will
            press forward with speed and urgency, for we have much to do in this winter of peril and
            possibility. <value change="restorative">Much to repair. Much to restore</value>. Much
            to heal. Much to build. And much to gain.</p>
        <p>Few periods in our nation’s history have been more challenging or difficult than the one
            we’re in now. <policy political="health">A once-in-a-century virus silently stalks the
                country</policy>. <tone emotion="mourning">It’s taken as many lives in one year as
                America lost in all of World War II</tone>. <policy political="jobs">Millions of
                jobs have been lost</policy>. Hundreds of thousands of businesses closed. <policy
                political="racial justice">A cry for racial justice some 400 years in the making
                moves us</policy>. The dream of justice for all will be deferred no longer. <policy
                political="climate">A cry for survival comes from the planet itself</policy>. A cry
            that can’t be any more desperate or any more clear. <policy political="terrorism">And
                now, a rise in political extremism, white supremacy, domestic terrorism that we must
                confront and we will defeat</policy>.</p>
        <p>To overcome these challenges – <value change="restorative">to restore the soul and to
                secure the future of America</value> – requires more than words. <value
                national="unity">It requires that most elusive of things in a democracy: Unity.
                Unity</value>.</p>
        <p>In another January in Washington, on New Year’s Day 1863, Abraham Lincoln signed the
            Emancipation Proclamation. When he put pen to paper, the President said, “If my name
            ever goes down into history it will be for this act and my whole soul is in it.” My
            whole soul is in it.</p>
        <p>Today, on this January day, my whole soul is in this: <value national="unity">Bringing
                America together. Uniting our people. And uniting our nation. I ask every American
                to join me in this cause. Uniting to fight the common foes we face: Anger,
                resentment, hatred. Extremism, lawlessness, violence. Disease, joblessness,
                hopelessness. With unity we can do great things. Important things. We can right
                wrongs</value>. <policy political="jobs">We can put people to work in good
                jobs</policy>. <policy political="education">We can teach our children in safe
                schools</policy>. <policy political="health">We can overcome this deadly
                virus</policy>. <policy>We can reward work, rebuild the middle class, and make
                health care secure for all</policy>. <policy political="racial justice">We can
                deliver racial justice</policy>. We can make America, once again, the leading force
            for good in the world.</p>
        <p>I know speaking of unity can sound to some like a foolish fantasy. I know the forces that
            divide us are deep and they are real. But I also know they are not new. Our history has
            been a constant struggle between the <value national="equality">American ideal that we
                are all created equal</value> and the harsh, ugly reality that racism, nativism,
            fear, and demonization have long torn us apart. The battle is perennial. Victory is
            never assured.</p>
        <p>Through the Civil War, the Great Depression, World War, 9/11, through struggle,
            sacrifice, and setbacks, <tone emotion="hope">our “better angels” have always
                prevailed</tone>. In each of these moments, enough of us came together to carry all
            of us forward. And, we can do so now.</p>
        <p><value national="unity">History, faith, and reason show the way, the way of unity. We can
                see each other not as adversaries but as neighbors. We can treat each other with
                dignity and respect. We can join forces, stop the shouting, and lower the
                temperature</value>. For without unity, there is no peace, only bitterness and fury.
            No progress, only exhausting outrage. No nation, only a state of chaos.</p>
        <p>This is our historic moment of crisis and challenge, and unity is the path forward. And,
            we must meet this moment as the United States of America. If we do that, <tone
                emotion="hope">I guarantee you, we will not fail</tone>. We have never, ever, ever
            failed in America when we have acted together.</p>
        <p>And so today, at this time and in this place, <value change="forwards">let us start
                afresh</value>. All of us. <value national="unity">Let us listen to one another.
                Hear one another. See one another. Show respect to one another</value>. Politics
            need not be a raging fire destroying everything in its path. Every disagreement doesn’t
            have to be a cause for total war. And, we must reject a culture in which facts
            themselves are manipulated and even manufactured.</p>
        <!--Still unsure about the following tone, maybe need to listen to speech-->
        <p><tone>My fellow Americans, we have to be different than this. America has to be better
                than this. And, I believe America is better than this</tone>. Just look around. Here
            we stand, in the shadow of a Capitol dome that was completed amid the Civil War, when
            the Union itself hung in the balance. Yet <tone emotion="hope">we endured and we
                prevailed</tone>. Here we stand looking out to the great Mall where Dr. King spoke
            of his dream. Here we stand, where 108 years ago at another inaugural, thousands of
            protestors tried to block brave women from marching for the right to vote. Today, we
            mark the swearing-in of the first woman in American history elected to national office –
            Vice President Kamala Harris.</p>
        <p>Don’t tell me things can’t change. Here we stand across the Potomac from Arlington
            National Cemetery, where heroes who gave the last full measure of devotion rest in
            eternal peace. And here we stand, <tone emotion="provoking">just days after a riotous
                mob thought they could use violence to silence the will of the people, to stop the
                work of our democracy, and to drive us from this sacred ground</tone>. That did not
            happen. It will never happen. Not today. Not tomorrow. Not ever.</p>
        <p>To all those who supported our campaign I am humbled by the faith you have placed in us.
            To all those who did not support us, let me say this: Hear me out as we move forward.
            Take a measure of me and my heart. And if you still disagree, so be it. That’s
            democracy. That’s America.</p>
        <p>The right to dissent peaceably, within the guardrails of our Republic, is perhaps our
            nation’s greatest strength. Yet hear me clearly: <value national="unity">Disagreement
                must not lead to disunion</value>. And I pledge this to you: I will be a President
            for all Americans. I will fight as hard for those who did not support me as for those
            who did.</p>
        <p><value religion="reference">Many centuries ago, Saint Augustine, a saint of my church,
                wrote that a people was a multitude defined by the common objects of their
                love</value>. What are the common objects we love that define us as Americans? I
            think I know. Opportunity. Security. Liberty. Dignity. Respect. Honor. And, yes, the
            truth.</p>
        <p>Recent weeks and months have taught us a painful lesson. There is truth and there are
            lies. Lies told for power and for profit. And each of us has a duty and responsibility,
            as citizens, as Americans, and especially as leaders – leaders who have pledged to honor
            our Constitution and protect our nation — to defend the truth and to defeat the
            lies.</p>
        <p>I understand that many Americans view the future with some fear and trepidation. I
            understand they worry about their jobs, about taking care of their families, about what
            comes next. I get it. But the answer is not to turn inward, to retreat into competing
            factions, distrusting those who don’t look like you do, or worship the way you do, or
            don’t get their news from the same sources you do.</p>
        <p><value national="unity">We must end this uncivil war that pits red against blue, rural
                versus urban, conservative versus liberal</value>. We can do this if we open our
            souls instead of hardening our hearts. If we show a little tolerance and humility. If
            we’re willing to stand in the other person’s shoes just for a moment. Because here is
            the thing about life: There is no accounting for what fate will deal you. There are some
            days when we need a hand. There are other days when we’re called on to lend one. That is
            how we must be with one another. <tone emotion="hope">And, if we are this way, our
                country will be stronger, more prosperous, more ready for the future</tone>.</p>
        <p>My fellow Americans, in the work ahead of us, we will need each other. <tone>
                emotion='warning'>We will need all our strength to persevere through this dark
                winter</tone>. We are entering what may well be the toughest and deadliest period of
            the virus. <value national="warning">We must set aside the politics and finally face
                this pandemic as one nation</value>.</p>
        <p>I promise you this: as the <value religion="reference">Bible says weeping may endure for
                a night but joy cometh in the morning</value>. <tone emotion="hope">We will get
                through this, together The world is watching today</tone>.</p>
        <p>So here is my message to those beyond our borders: America has been tested and we have
            come out stronger for it. <policy political="foreign relations">We will repair our
                alliances and engage with the world once again</policy>. Not to meet yesterday’s
            challenges, but today’s and tomorrow’s. <tone emotion="pride">We will lead not merely by
                the example of our power but by the power of our example</tone>. We will be a strong
            and trusted partner for peace, progress, and security.</p>
        <p>We have been through so much in this nation. And, in my first act as President, <value
                religion="prayer">I would like to ask you to join me in a moment of silent
                prayer</value> to remember all those we lost this past year to the pandemic. <tone
                emotion="mourning">To those 400,000 fellow Americans – mothers and fathers, husbands
                and wives, sons and daughters, friends, neighbors, and co-workers. We will honor
                them by becoming the people and nation we know we can and should be. Let us say a
                silent prayer for those who lost their lives, for those they left behind, and for
                our country. Amen</tone>.</p>
        <p>This is a time of testing. We face an attack on democracy and on truth. <policy
                political="health">A raging virus</policy>. <policy political="inequality">Growing
                inequity</policy>. <policy political="racial justice">The sting of systemic
                racism</policy>. <policy political="climate">A climate in crisis</policy>. <policy
                political="foreign relations">America’s role in the world</policy>. Any one of these
            would be enough to challenge us in profound ways. But the fact is we face them all at
            once, presenting this nation with the gravest of responsibilities. <value
                national="action">Now we must step up. All of us</value>.</p>
        <p>It is a time for boldness, for there is so much to do. And, this is certain. We will be
            judged, you and I, for how we resolve the cascading crises of our era. Will we rise to
            the occasion? Will we master this rare and difficult hour? Will we meet our obligations
            and pass along a new and better world for our children? I believe we must and <tone
                emotion="hope">I believe we will</tone>. And when we do, we will write the next
            chapter in the American story.</p>
        <p>It’s a story that might sound something like a song that means a lot to me. It’s called
            “American Anthem” and there is one verse stands out for me: “The work and prayers of
            centuries have brought us to this day What shall be our legacy? What will our children
            say?… Let me know in my heart When my days are through America America I gave my best to
            you.”</p>
        <p>Let us add our own work and prayers to the unfolding story of our nation. If we do this
            then when our days are through our children and our children’s children will say of us
            they gave their best. They did their duty. They healed a broken land.</p>
        <p>My fellow Americans, I close today where I began, with a sacred oath. Before <value
                religion="reference">God</value> and all of you I give you my word. I will always
            level with you. I will defend the Constitution. I will defend our democracy. I will
            defend America. I will give my all in your service thinking not of power, but of
            possibilities. Not of personal interest, but of the public good. And together, <tone
                emotion="hope">we shall write an American story of hope</tone>, not fear. Of <value
                national="unity">unity</value>, not division. Of light, not darkness. An American
            story of decency and dignity. Of love and of healing. Of greatness and of goodness. May
            this be the story that guides us. The story that inspires us. The story that tells ages
            yet to come that we answered the call of history.</p>
        <p>We met the moment. That democracy and hope, truth and justice, did not die on our watch
            but thrived. That our America secured liberty at home and stood once again as a beacon
            to the world. That is what we owe our forebearers, one another, and generations to
            follow. So, with purpose and resolve we turn to the tasks of our time. Sustained by
                <value religion="reference">faith</value>. Driven by conviction. And, devoted to one
            another and to this country we love with all our hearts.</p>
        <p>May <value religion="reference">God bless America</value> and may <policy
                political="military">God protect our troops</policy>. Thank you, America.</p>
