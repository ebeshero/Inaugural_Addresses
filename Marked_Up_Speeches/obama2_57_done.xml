        <p>Vice President Biden, Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the U.S. Congress, distinguished
            guests, and fellow citizens, each time we gather to inaugurate a President, we bear
            witness to the enduring strength of our Constitution. <policy political='democracy'>We affirm the promise of our
                democracy</policy>. We recall that what binds this Nation together are not the colors of our skin
            or the tenets of our faith or the origins of our names. <value national='patriotism'>What makes us exceptional--what
                makes us American</value>--is our allegiance to an idea, articulated in a declaration made more
            than two centuries ago:</p>
        <p>We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are
            endowed by their <value religion='reference'>Creator</value> with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life,
            Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.</p>
        <p>Today we continue a never-ending journey to bridge the meaning of those words with the
            realities of our time, for history tells us that while these truths may be self-evident,
            they have never been self-executing; that while freedom is a gift from God it must be
            secured by His people here on Earth.</p>
        <p><policy political='democracy'>The patriots of 1776 did not fight to replace the tyranny of a king with the privileges
            of a few or the rule of a mob</policy>. They gave to us a republic, a government of and by and
            for the people, entrusting each generation to keep safe our founding creed. For more
            than 200 years, we have. Through blood drawn by lash and blood drawn by sword, <value national='equality'>we
            learned that no union founded on the principles of liberty and equality could survive
            half slave and half free</value>. <value change='forward'>We made ourselves anew and vowed to move forward together</value>.
            <policy political='industry'>Together, we determined that a modern economy requires railroads and highways to speed
                travel and commerce</policy>; <policy political='education'>schools and colleges to train our workers</policy>. Together, we discovered
            <policy political='economy'>that a free market only thrives when there are rules to ensure competition and fair
                play</policy>. Together, we resolve that a great nation must care for the vulnerable and protect
            its people from life's worst hazards and misfortunes. <policy political='democracy'>Through it all, we have never
            relinquished our skepticism of central authority, nor have we succumbed to the fiction
            that all society's ills can be cured through government alone</policy>. Our celebration of
            initiative and enterprise, our insistence on hard work and personal responsibility,
            these are constants in our character.</p>
        <p><value change='forwards'>We have always understood that when times change, so must we; that fidelity to our
            founding principles requires new responses to new challenges</value>; that <value national='action'>preserving our
                individual freedoms ultimately requires collective action</value>, for the American people can
            no more meet the demands of today's world by acting alone than American soldiers could
            have met the <policy political='democracy'>forces of fascism or communism</policy> with muskets and militias. No single person
            can train all the <policy political='education'>math and science teachers we will need to equip our children</policy> for the
            future or build the roads and networks and research labs that will <policy political='jobs'>bring new jobs to our
                shores</policy>. Now, more than ever, we must do these things <value national='unity'>together as one Nation and one
            people</value>.</p>
        <p>This generation of Americans has been tested by crises that steeled our resolve and
            proved our resilience. A decade of war is now ending.</p>
        <p><policy political='economy'>An economic recovery has begun</policy>.</p>
        <p><tone emotion=pride>America's possibilities are limitless, for we possess all the qualities this world
            without boundaries demands: youth and drive, diversity and openness, an endless capacity
            for risk, and a gift for reinvention</tone>.</p>
        <p>My fellow Americans, we are made for this moment, and we will seize it so long as we
            seize it together.</p>
        <p>For we, the People, understand that our country cannot succeed when a shrinking few do
            very well and a growing many barely make it.</p>
        <p>We believe America's prosperity must rest upon the broad shoulders of a rising middle
            class. <policy political='jobs'>We know America thrives when every person can find independence and pride in
                their work, when the wages of honest labor liberate families from the brink of hardship</policy>.
            <tone emotion='pride'>We are true to our creed when a little girl born into the bleakest poverty knows she has
                the same chance to succeed as anybody else because she is an American</tone>, she is free, and
            she is equal, not just in the eyes of <value religion='reference'>God</value> but also in our own.</p>
        <p><value change='forwards'>We understand outworn programs are inadequate to the needs of our time. We must harness
            new ideas in technology to remake our government</value>, <policy political='taxes'>revamp our Tax Code</policy>, <policy political='education'>reform our
                schools</policy>, and empower our citizens with the skills they need to work harder, learn more,
            and reach higher. But while the means will change, our purpose endures. A nation that
            rewards the effort and determination of every single American, that is what this moment
            requires. That is what will give real meaning to our creed.</p>
        <p>We, the people, still believe that every citizen deserves a basic measure of security and
            dignity. We must make the hard choices to reduce the cost of <policy political='healthcare'>health care</policy> and the size of
            our deficit. But we reject the belief that America must choose between caring for the
            generation that built this country and investing in the generation that will build its
            future.</p>
        <p>For we remember the lessons of our past, when twilight years were spent in poverty and
            parents of a child with a disability had nowhere to turn. <policy political='democracy'>We do not believe, in this
                country, freedom is reserved for the lucky or happiness for the few</policy>. We recognize that
            no matter how responsibly we live our lives, any one of us, at any time, may face a job
            loss or a sudden illness or a home swept away in a terrible storm. <policy political='healthcare'>The commitments we
                make to each other, through Medicare and Medicaid and Social Security</policy>, these things do
            not sap our Nation; they strengthen us.</p>
        <p>They do not make us a nation of takers; they free us to take the risks that make this
            country great.</p>
        <p>We, the people, still believe our obligations as Americans are not just to ourselves but
            to all posterity. We will respond to the threat of <policy political='climate'>climate change</policy>, knowing the failure
            to do so would betray our children and future generations.</p>
        <p>Some may still deny the overwhelming judgment of science, but none can avoid the
            <policy political='climate'>devastating impact of raging fires and crippling drought and more powerful storms</policy>. The
            path toward sustainable energy sources will be long and sometimes difficult, but America
            cannot resist this transition; we must lead it. We cannot cede to other Nations the
            technology that will power new jobs and new industries; we must claim its promise. That
            is how we will maintain our economic vitality and our national treasure, our forests and
            waterways, our croplands and snow-capped peaks. That is how we will preserve our planet,
            commanded to our care by <value religion='reference'>God</value>. That is what will lend meaning to the creed our Fathers
            once declared.</p>
        <p>We, the people, still believe that enduring security and lasting peace do not require
            perpetual war. <policy political='military'>Our brave men and women in uniform, tempered by the flames of battle, are
                unmatched in skill and courage. Our citizens, seared by the memory of those we have
            lost, know too well the price that is paid for liberty. The knowledge of their sacrifice
            will keep us forever vigilant against those who would do us harm. But we are also heirs
            to those who won the peace and not just the war, who turned sworn enemies into the
            surest of friends</policy>, and we must carry those lessons into this time as well.</p>
        <p>We will defend our people and uphold our values through strength of arms and rule of law.
            We will show the courage to try and resolve our differences with other Nations
            peacefully, not because we are naive about the dangers we face but because engagement
            can more durably lift suspicion and fear.</p>
        <p><policy political='foreign relations'>America will remain the anchor of strong alliances in every corner of the globe, and we
            will renew those institutions that extend our capacity to manage crisis abroad</policy>, for no
            one has a greater stake in a peaceful world than its <tone emotion pride>most powerful Nation</tone>. <political policy='democracy'>We will
            support democracy from Asia to Africa, from the Americas to the Middle East, because our
            interests and our conscience compel us to act on behalf of those who long for freedom</political>.
            <value national='patriotism'>We must be a source of hope</value> to the poor, the sick, the marginalized, the victims of
            prejudice, not out of mere charity but because peace in our time requires the constant
            advance of those principles that our common creed describes: tolerance and opportunity,
            human dignity and justice.</p>
        <p>We, the people, declare today that the most evident of truths, <value national='equality'>that all of us are created
            equal</value>, is the star that guides us still, just as it guided our forebears through Seneca
            Falls and Selma and Stonewall, just as it guided all those men and women, sung and
            unsung, who left footprints along this great Mall to hear a preacher say we cannot walk
            alone, to hear a ``King'' proclaim that our individual freedom is inextricably bound to
            the freedom of every soul on Earth.</p>
        <p><value national='equality'>It is now our generation's task to carry on what those pioneers began, for our journey is
            not complete until our wives, our mothers, and daughters can earn a living equal to
            their efforts. Our journey is not complete until our gay brothers and sisters are
            treated like anyone else under the law, for if we are truly created equal, then surely
            the love we commit to one another must be equal as well</value>.</p>
        <p>Our journey is not complete until no citizen is forced to wait for hours to exercise the
            right to vote. Our journey is not complete until we find a better way to <policy political='immigration'>welcome the
            striving, hopeful immigrants who still see America as a land of opportunity; until
            bright young students and engineers are enlisted in our workforce rather than expelled
            from our country</policy>.</p>
        <p>Our journey is not complete until all our children, from the streets of Detroit to the
            hills of Appalachia, to the quiet lanes of Newtown, <value national='protection'>know they are cared for and
                cherished and always safe from harm</value>. That is our generation's task--to make these words,
            these rights, these values of life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness real for
            every American.</p>
        <p><value national='unity'>Being true to our founding documents does not require us to agree on every contour of
            life. It does not mean we will all define liberty in exactly the same way or follow the
            same precise path to happiness</value>. Progress does not compel us to settle centuries-long
            debates about the role of government for all time, but it does require us to act in our
            time.</p>
        <p>For now decisions are upon us, and we cannot afford delay. We cannot mistake absolutism
            for principle or substitute spectacle for politics or treat name-calling as reasoned
            debate. <value national='action'>We must act, knowing our work will be imperfect. We must act, knowing today's
            victories will be only partial and that it will be up to those who stand here in 4 years
            and 40 years and 400 years hence to advance the timeless spirit once conferred to us in
            a spare Philadelphia hall</value>.</p>
        <p>My fellow Americans, the oath I have sworn before you today, similar to the one recited
            by others who serve in this Capitol, was an oath to <value religion='reference'>God</value> and country, not party or
            faction, and we must faithfully execute that pledge during the duration of our service.
            But the words I spoke today are not so different from the oath that is taken each time a
            soldier signs up for duty or an immigrant realizes her dream. My oath is not so
            different from the pledge we all make to the <tone emotion='pride'>flag that waves above and that fills our
                hearts with pride</tone>. They are the words of citizens and they represent our greatest
            hope.</p>
        <p>You and I, as citizens, have the power to set this country's course. You and I, as
            citizens, have the obligation to shape the debates of our time, not only with the votes
            we cast but with the voices we lift in defense of our most ancient values and enduring
            ideals. Let each of us now embrace, with solemn duty and awesome joy, what is our
            lasting birthright. With common effort and common purpose, with passion and dedication,
            let us answer the call of history and carry into an uncertain future that precious light
            of freedom.</p>
        <p>Thank you. God bless you, and may He forever bless these United States of America.</p>
